# Turning Heartbreak into Hope: A Cost‑Effective Safety Device

This repository documents my **Amal Fellowship mega project**, developed with a team of nine fellows.  
We designed a **wearable GPS safety device** to provide affordable protection for women and children in Pakistan.  
The project was motivated by tragic events in our community and aimed to turn heartbreak into hope by creating a practical, low‑cost solution.

## Project Overview
- Developed a GPS‑based wearable device with **location tracking** and a **one‑touch emergency alert**.
- Designed for affordability compared to expensive versions in developed countries.
- Focused on accessibility for families and children in local communities.

## Key Features
1. Real‑time Location Tracking  
2. One‑Touch Emergency Alert  
3. Family Connection Feature  
4. Affordable Design  
5. Signal‑Based Functionality  
6. Rechargeable Battery  
7. Inclusive Wearable Options  
8. Ethical Data Access  

## Outcomes
- Worked best for children playing near home.  
- Highlighted limitations for women traveling long distances, but served as a **first step toward safety and hope**.  
- Demonstrated the potential of **community‑driven innovation** in addressing urgent social challenges.
